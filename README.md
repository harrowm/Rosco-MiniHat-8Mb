# Rosco-Minihat-8Mb
A 8Mb memory hat for the rosco_m68k SBC


This design has not been built or tested.  The use of 2Mb chips means moving to 3.3v with buffer chips and a voltage regulator.  This is really too much to cram into a "hat" type board.  When I find the time I will redesign as a normal board as I have the parts on hand ..
